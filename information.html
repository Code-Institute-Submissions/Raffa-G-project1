                <br>
                <p>Ethical vegans have made the link that there is no difference between a dog and a pig or a cat 
                    and a fish. They are all sentient beings and creatures that want to live. Furthermore, ethical 
                    vegans find factory farming cruel and nothing like the marketing adverts showing happy cows 
                    grazing in lush green fields. Creatures bred for our plates live short and miserable lives,
                     therefore the only way ethical vegans can see to protect them is by abstaining from all animal 
                     products.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Animals are sentient creatures that have a right to live. Ethical vegans believe that 
                        killing to eat is wrong. Why do we protect dogs from being hit by punishing perpetrators 
                        yet encourage pig farmers due to the demand for bacon? How can one page in a magazine tell
                         readers to adopt a cat from a shelter, while the other side advertises fresh Atlantic salmon?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ethical Vegans are those who have chosen a vegan lifestyle, as they are firmly against 
                        animal-cruelty. This type of vegans don't want their life to involve exploiting animals 
                        in anyway. About a third of people who choose to go vegan, do it for the animals.

            <p>Another type of vegan are environmental vegans. These individuals go vegan as a way of 
                living a greener lifestyle and in a bid to do their bit for the planet.
                <br>
            Environmental vegans believe that by adopting a vegan diet they are helping to reduce 
            greenhouse gas emissions, minimise their contribution to deforestation and reduce pollution 
            by not supporting animal agriculture.
            <br>
            Did you know that animal agriculture is accountable for more greenhouse gases than all the 
            world's transportation systems?</p>
