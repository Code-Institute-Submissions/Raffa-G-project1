                <p>There are many ways to embrace vegan living. Yet one thing all vegans have in common 
                    is a plant-based diet avoiding all animal foods such as meat, fish, dairy, eggs and honey 
                    - as well as avoiding animal-derived materials, products tested on animals 
                    and places that use animals for entertainment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><em>"Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude —as far as is possible 
                        and practicable— all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing 
                        or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free 
                        alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it 
                        denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals."</em>

                    <p>Some people will choose to go vegan because they do not agree with farmed animal practices 
                        and animal exploitation, some will do it due to environmental concerns and to 
                        take a stand against inefficient food systems which disproportionately affect the poorest 
                        people all over the world, others for the numerous health benefits that a well-planned 
                        vegan diet can provide. More often then not the reason will be a well rounded mixture off 
                        all the above.
