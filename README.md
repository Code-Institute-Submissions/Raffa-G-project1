 The website was deployed to GitHup pages.
- The steps to deploy it were as folows:
    - In the GitHub repository I navigated to the 'Settings' tab
    - On the left collum menu, in the 'Code and automation' section, clicked on the link: 'Pages'
    - On the 'Build and deployment' area of the page, the 'Source' section drop-down menu must have active the option: 'Deploy from a branch'
